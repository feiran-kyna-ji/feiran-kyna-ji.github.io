## Hi! I am Kyna :D
I am currently a master candidate in Data Science at University of San Francisco. I am also a data science intern at Ubisoft. Prior to that, I graduated with a double major in Business and East Asian Studies at University of Southern California, where I began to be fascinated by the business potential for data in predicting future trends. I enjoy building machine learning models to predict, and I am passionate about data-driven business decision-making.
 
My data science skillset includes:
* Programming: Python, R, Spark, Matlab, Excel
* Visualizations: Tableau, ggplot2, Matplotlib
* Databases: SQL(PostgreSQL, Oracle 11g, Microsoft SQL, Teradata), NoSQL(MongoDB)
* Machine learning skills (Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network)
