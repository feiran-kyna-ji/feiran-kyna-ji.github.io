# Hi! I am Kyna :D

I am currently a master candidate in Data Science at University of San Francisco. I am also a data science intern at Ubisoft. Prior to that, I graduated with a double major in Business and East Asian Studies at University of Southern California, where I began to be fascinated by the business potential for data in predicting future trends. I enjoy building machine learning models to predict, and I am passionate about data-driven business decision-making.

My data science skillset includes:
* Programming: Python, R, Spark, Matlab, Excel
* Visualizations: Tableau, ggplot2, Matplotlib
* Databases: SQL(PostgreSQL, Oracle 11g, Microsoft SQL, Teradata), NoSQL(MongoDB)
* Machine learning skills
  - Regression
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Neural Networks
  - Nature Language Processing
