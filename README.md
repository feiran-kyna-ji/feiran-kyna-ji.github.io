## Hi! I am Kyna :)
I am currently finishing my Master's of Science in Data Science (MSDS) at University of San Francisco. I am also a data science intern at Ubisoft. Prior to that, I graduated with a double major in Business and East Asian Studies at University of Southern California, where I began to be fascinated by the business potential for data in predicting future trends. I enjoy building machine learning models to predict, and I am passionate about data-driven business decision-making. Check my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pGKs9Y7ZbKjowV74A_S49X8WMTeQwRnh/view?usp=sharing).

In my own time, I love traveling and photography. You can find some of the photos I took [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/128336669@N08/albums).
