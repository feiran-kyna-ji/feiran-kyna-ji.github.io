## Hi! I am Kyna =D
I am currently finishing my Master's of Science in Data Science (MSDS) at University of San Francisco. I am also a data science intern at Ubisoft. Prior to that, I graduated with a double major in Business and East Asian Studies at University of Southern California, where I began to be fascinated by the business potential for data in predicting future trends. I enjoy building machine learning models to predict, and I am passionate about data-driven business decision-making. Check my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pGKs9Y7ZbKjowV74A_S49X8WMTeQwRnh/view?usp=sharing).

My data science skillset includes:
* Programming: Python, R, SQL, NoSQL, Spark, Matlab
* Tools: AWS, Hadoop, Git, Latex, Bash, Tableau
* Statistical Methods (A/B Testing, Regression, Time Series, Hypothesis Testing, Bayesian Analysis)
* Machine learning skills (Random Forest, Boosting, Neural Networks, Clustering, Recommendation System, Natural Language Processing, Matrix Factorization)
